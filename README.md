Loc-Talk
========

This is an Android Application that facilitates chatting and sharing files over WiFi without using Internet Connection.

Using this Application, people connected to the same WiFi (like in a Mall or a Cafeteria), can chat, share data and can know the on-going deals and offers an that particular place.
They will get an exclusive portion/ arena to discuss about the ongoing deals and offers and can even post their own Advertisements to promote their products or events.

There will be two different Versions of this Application, Paid and Non-Paid, to distinguish the Advertisements and Promotions of a specfic user. If a Paid user wants to Promote or Advertise, then he/she will get an exclusive arena/tab for that and his'her Posts will be featured to each and every user connected to that WiFi.

There will be NO Central Server monitoring the Activities or maintaing the Database. This system will act as a Distributed System with each mobile device acting as a Server in it's own. And hence, the App won't use any Internet Connection to run and just the WiFi.
